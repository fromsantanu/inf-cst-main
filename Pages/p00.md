## What are Inferential case studies ?

Inferential case studies are analytical processes where **conclusions about a larger population** are drawn based on **data collected from a sample**. These case studies go beyond merely describing data (as in descriptive analysis) to **making predictions, testing hypotheses, and drawing inferences** with a degree of certainty.

### ‚úÖ **Key Steps in Conducting Inferential Case Studies**

---

#### **1. Define the Problem and Objective**

* **What are you trying to infer or test?**
* Example: *Does a new teaching method improve student performance compared to the traditional method?*

---

#### **2. Identify the Population and Select a Sample**

* Define your **target population** (e.g., all students in a region).
* Choose a **representative sample** using techniques like:

  * Random sampling
  * Stratified sampling
  * Cluster sampling

---

#### **3. Collect Data**

* Use reliable methods:

  * Surveys
  * Observations
  * Experiments
  * Secondary data sources
* Ensure data is **valid, unbiased, and accurate**.

---

#### **4. Formulate Hypotheses**

* **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** No effect or no difference.
* **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** There is an effect or difference.

Example:

* H‚ÇÄ: New teaching method = Traditional method
* H‚ÇÅ: New teaching method ‚â† Traditional method

---

#### **5. Choose the Right Inferential Test**

Based on your objective and data type:

* **T-tests**: Comparing means (e.g., before vs. after treatment)
* **ANOVA**: Comparing more than two groups
* **Chi-square test**: For categorical variables
* **Correlation/Regression**: For relationships between variables

---

#### **6. Check Assumptions of the Test**

* Normality
* Homogeneity of variances
* Independence of observations
* Randomness

Use diagnostic tools or plots (Q-Q plots, histograms, Shapiro-Wilk test, etc.).

---

#### **7. Perform Statistical Test**

* Use software (R, Python, SPSS, etc.).
* Calculate:

  * Test statistic
  * **P-value**
  * **Confidence interval**

---

#### **8. Interpret the Results**

* If **p-value < significance level (e.g., 0.05)** ‚Üí Reject H‚ÇÄ
* Report the **practical significance**, not just statistical.
* Discuss:

  * Effect sizes
  * Confidence intervals
  * Limitations of the analysis

---

#### **9. Draw Conclusions and Make Inferences**

* **Generalize findings** to the population (with caution).
* Example: *"The new teaching method significantly improves student performance."*

---

#### **10. Report and Validate**

* Write a report with:

  * Introduction
  * Methodology
  * Statistical analysis
  * Conclusion
* Ensure peer review, replication, or cross-validation.

### üß™ **Example Use Case: Drug Effectiveness Study**

**Objective:** Test whether a new drug lowers blood pressure.
**Method:**

* Randomly select 100 patients (sample) from a population.
* Divide into control and treatment groups.
* After treatment, apply **independent sample t-test**.
* If **p < 0.05**, conclude the drug is effective for the population.
